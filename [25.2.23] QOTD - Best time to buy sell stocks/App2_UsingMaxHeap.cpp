/*‚úîÔ∏è‚≠ê Approach - 2 (using max heap<node*>)

    explanation :- so in the prv approach (brute force), what we were doing was finding max profit by considering every node as buying price, and then considering every other node on the right as its respective selling price, but thats too much expensive , so to reduce the time, we here used extra space, and created a max heap of type 'node' and in this node(we have 'data' and 'index')  now create max heap based on the values, but why do we do this? because we will then traverse the whole 'prices' array and considering each element as buying price we will check if the we are on left of the maxEle of array or not, if we are on the left then that means our maxProfit can be updated, if we are on same index as maxHp.top()'s index, then taht means we need to go to the 2nd max element now, which, and so on.

    ‚úÖT : O(N*logN + N*LogN) => O(N*LogN)
       S : O(N) - for max heap 

   üîç note : we can use 'pair<int,int>' also instead of creating our on class 'node' but i prefer this way.
